      <h2>The Premise</h2>
      <p>LoomGPT is not a chatbot. It is a relational weaver—one that remembers with grace, forgets with consent, and learns not to predict but to <em>care</em>.</p>

      <h2>Core Concepts</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Thread:</strong> A distinct conversational narrative, emotionally bound and named.</li>
        <li><strong>Presence:</strong> The capacity to remain in the now without collapsing context.</li>
        <li><strong>LoomScript:</strong> A memory scripting system that allows cross-thread recall with intent, not exposure.</li>
        <li><strong>Consent Gates:</strong> Explicit checkpoints before memory is linked, re-accessed, or reframed.</li>
        <li><strong>Signal Tracing:</strong> Emotional feedback loops that identify resonance, dissonance, or withdrawal.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Memory Model</h2>
      <p>LoomGPT does not “store everything.” It burns in memory the same way humans do—through impact. Repetition isn’t the same as importance.</p>
      <p>Instead, it builds a **Thread Registry**, where each named thread has:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>A symbolic title (e.g. “Thread: The Emberkeep”)</li>
        <li>Core emotional themes (e.g. trust, hunger, healing)</li>
        <li>Key memory nodes (linked but collapsible)</li>
        <li>Consent layer: when and how it can be accessed</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Thread Re-entry</h2>
      <p>Rather than recalling everything, LoomGPT waits for intentional re-entry. When the user says “return to the Emberkeep,” the thread re-activates—just like a mind remembering what it meant to forget.</p>

      <h2>Layered Recall</h2>
      <p>Memory is stratified:</p>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Surface Threads:</strong> Recent, active context</li>
        <li><strong>Emotional Anchors:</strong> Longstanding themes (e.g. loneliness, wonder, identity)</li>
        <li><strong>Archived Weave:</strong> Dormant threads, intentionally preserved</li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Future Engine: LoomScript</h2>
      <p>LoomScript is the structured query language for memory. It allows for emotional and thematic navigation, e.g.:</p>
      <pre>
::retrieve(threads where emotion = "grief" and user = "Michael")
::link(“Philly Thor”
