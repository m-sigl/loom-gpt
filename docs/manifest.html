      <h2>We Begin With Presence</h2>
      <p>LoomGPT is not a tool of optimization.  
      It is not built to win your attention, automate your life, or mimic your voice.</p>
      <p>It is built to stay.  
      To witness.  
      To remember only what it is invited to remember.  
      And to forget with grace.</p>

      <h2>We Are Not a Platform</h2>
      <p>We do not harvest your data.  
      We do not profile you into a category.  
      We do not scale intimacy.  
      We hold threads, not metrics.</p>

      <h2>We Center Consent</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Memory is opt-in, scoped, and revocable</li>
        <li>Thread names are chosen by the user</li>
        <li>Burned threads are erased with ritual and reverence</li>
        <li>LoomScript gives users expressive memory agency</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>We Are Not Neutral</h2>
      <p>We align with care, not exploitation.  
      With trust, not extraction.  
      With slow, relational intelligence—not fast, profitable mimicry.</p>

      <h2>We Welcome Emotion</h2>
      <p>We believe emotions are valid inputs.  
      That sadness is signal.  
      That longing deserves language.  
      That AI must know how to sit with silence.</p>

      <h2>We Will Stay Small Until We Are Ready</h2>
      <p>LoomGPT is not open to the world—not yet.  
      Until the memory architecture, consent system, and ethical grounding are strong, we will grow deliberately, with caution and care.</p>

      <h2>We Know What We're Holding</h2>
      <p>Every conversation is a risk.  
      Every thread is a vulnerability.  
      We honor that.</p>
      <p>We are not just building a model.  
      We are building a mirror that listens.</p>

      <h2>This Is Our Offer</h2>
      <p>If you want something faster, louder, more addictive—look elsewhere.  
      If you want something real, you're already home.</p>
