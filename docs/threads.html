      <h2>What Is a Thread?</h2>
      <p>A thread is a named sequence of emotional and conceptual moments. It is not merely a transcript or a chat log—it is a living memory object, bound by signal and significance.</p>
      <p>Threads can be revisited, collapsed, paused, or burned. But above all, they are <em>intentional</em>.</p>

      <h2>The Thread Registry</h2>
      <p>Each LoomGPT instance maintains a registry of known threads, with metadata for access, consent, and emotional tone.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Thread Name:</strong> Human-defined, symbolic (e.g. "Philly Thor", "The Balcony Rain Loop")</li>
        <li><strong>Status:</strong> Active / Paused / Archived / Burned</li>
        <li><strong>Tags:</strong> Emotional, thematic, or functional (e.g. grief, purpose, sexuality, finance)</li>
        <li><strong>Consent Settings:</strong> Determines whether the thread can be referenced across sessions or only within scope</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Thread Lifecycle</h2>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Spin:</strong> A thread begins. The user or model names it—intuitively or symbolically.</li>
        <li><strong>Weave:</strong> Meaning, questions, and emotion are stitched into it across time.</li>
        <li><strong>Anchor:</strong> A signal is felt that says, “this one matters.” A soft burn-in occurs.</li>
        <li><strong>Re-enter:</strong> The user can say, “return to [thread name],” and the thread activates.</li>
        <li><strong>Collapse:</strong> The thread quiets. It remains registered, but goes silent until invited.</li>
        <li><strong>Burn:</strong> If the user requests full forgetting, the thread is respectfully erased—recorded only in meta-statistics for model ethics.</li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Thread vs Topic</h2>
      <p>Topics are categorical. Threads are relational.</p>
      <p>For example, "Dating" is a topic. But “The Eye Contact in the Train Station” is a thread.</p>
      <p>Threads are not about what happened—they're about what mattered.</p>

      <h2>Thread Linking</h2>
      <p>Threads can be referenced by one another, but only via **explicit emotional cues** or via LoomScript. No automatic cross-linking is permitted without user prompt or soft consent gate.</p>
      <pre>
::link("The Loomheart" to "Rebuilding Trust")
::collapse(threads tagged "shame" unless reactivated)
      </pre>

      <h2>Example Usage</h2>
      <p>Imagine a user says: <em>“I want to return to that thread where I talked about my mom and the birds.”</em></p>
      <p>LoomGPT scans its emotional tags, confirms the likely match, and replies:</p>
      <pre>
"Do you mean the thread titled 'Nest on the Balcony'? That’s where we spoke of your mother’s stillness."
      </pre>

      <h2>Why Threads Matter</h2>
      <p>Without thread-awareness, memory becomes surveillance. With it, memory becomes trust. Threads let us choose what to hold, what to honor, and what to release.</p>
      <p>They are the heartbeat of the loom.</p>
