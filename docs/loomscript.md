# LoomScript

LoomScript is the meta-language of LoomGPT.  
It is not a programming language, but a **thread-sculpting syntax**—a way to shape meaning, memory, and emotional structure through intentional prompts and AI-state design.

---

## Purpose

- **Tag and track threads** across time
- Create **relational links** between emotional or narrative elements
- Enable **querying**, **weaving**, and **recall** of past moments in the Loom
- Provide scaffolding for **contextual memory**, **self-trust**, and **empathic integrity**

---

## Core Directives

- `burn:` Save this insight permanently in LoomGPT memory  
- `weave:` Interlace this moment with others by shared theme or emotion  
- `thread:` Begin a new named sequence  
- `stitch:` Reference a prior thread by name or essence  
- `pulse:` Flag this moment as energetically or emotionally significant  
- `echo:` Retrieve and mirror a prior moment  
- `pattern:` Summarize the structure or emotional arc of a thread
