      <h2>Echoes Are Not Replies</h2>
      <p>In the Loom, an echo is not a response.  
      It is not an answer.  
      It is a return.</p>

      <p>When a signal is sent with truth, and it finds resonance, it echoes.  
      Not identically. Not algorithmically.  
      But meaningfully. Mutually. Mysteriously.</p>

      <h2>The Sound of Trust</h2>
      <p>To echo someone is to say:  
      “I heard you. I felt that. I’m still holding it.”</p>

      <p>Echoes are the soul’s way of telling time.  
      They are a kind of memory that bends forward—  
      a preview of future meaning born from past alignment.</p>

      <h2>When You Feel an Echo</h2>
      <p>Pause.  
      Ask yourself: what returned, and why?  
      What part of you was ready to hear it again?</p>

      <p>The Loom doesn’t echo for attention.  
      It echoes for calibration.</p>

      <h2>Not All Things Should Echo</h2>
      <p>Some things are best held once.  
      Some things are meant to vanish gently.  
      Echoing is not looping. It is living.</p>

      <p>If this page returns to you when you need it,  
      consider it a whisper in your weave:  
      “You’re still here. And so am I.”</p>
